# 1.3 Transforming XIAO and its Expansion Board into a Morse Code Transmitter {.unnumbered}

Everyone knows that "SOS" is an internationally recognized emergency signal, a form of Morse code. Today, we will transform Seeed Studio's XIAO into a Morse code transmitter. We will try to make the onboard buzzer of the expansion board send signals automatically. In addition, we will learn how to control the buzzer manually with a button. \## 1.3.1 Background Knowledge \### 1.3.1.1 Buzzer A buzzer is an integrated electronic sound device that generates sound based on the input of an electrical signal. Buzzers are often installed on electronic products for sound generation. There are two types of buzzers: active (source buzzers) and passive (sourceless buzzers).

-   **Active Buzzers:** These buzzers have a simple oscillation circuit inside. When connected to a DC power supply, the buzzer can convert a constant DC into a certain frequency pulse signal, thereby driving the internal aluminum sheet to vibrate and make a sound. Active buzzers can usually only emit some fixed-pitch (frequency) sounds and are widely used in the sound devices of computers, printers, copiers, alarms, electronic toys, car electronics, phones, timers, and other electronic products.
-   **Passive Buzzers:** These buzzers work similarly to loudspeakers. They don't have an internal oscillator and need to be connected to a changing current signal to work. They usually use different frequency square wave signals for driving. The sound generated by passive buzzers will change according to the change in input signal, and they can output a variety of sounds like speakers, not just emitting a fixed single tone (frequency).

We can output PWM pulse signals to this pin to control the buzzer. ![XIAO蜂鸣器.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2021/png/2746511/1612687823459-80d12700-2195-426b-adef-2e97dd5dd36e.png#averageHue=%23686866&height=303&id=Ky3GI&originHeight=383&originWidth=413&originalType=binary&ratio=1&rotation=0&showTitle=false&size=28973&status=done&style=none&title=&width=327) \### 1.3.1.2 `tone()` and `noTone()` Functions \#### `tone()`Function The `tone()`function can generate a fixed frequency PWM signal to drive a passive buzzer to make a sound, and it can define the frequency and duration of the sound. \##### Syntax: `tone(pin, frequency);` `tone(pin, frequency, duration);` \##### Parameters: `pin:` The pin to which the buzzer is connected (in the Seeed Studio XIAO expansion board, it's A3). `frequency:`The frequency of the sound (unit: Hz), the type allowed is unsigned integer. `duration:`The duration of the sound (unit: milliseconds, this parameter is optional), the type allowed is unsigned long.

#### `noTone()` Function

This function is used to stop the sound of the buzzer controlled by the `tone()` function. If there is no sound generated, the function is invalid. \##### Syntax: `noTone(pin);` \##### Parameters: `pin:` The pin to stop the sound. \### 1.3.1.3 Common Operators In previous studies, we have used some operators. Next, we will learn about common types of operators and their usage methods. \#### Arithmetic Operators: \| Operator \| Explanation \| \| --- \| --- \| \| = \| Assignment operator \| \| + \| Addition operator \| \| - \| Subtraction operator \| \| \* \| Multiplication operator \| \| / \| Division operator \| \| % \| Modulus operator \|

There is no distinction between upper and lower case letters. Each Morse code symbol consists of a series of dots (·) and dashes (---). The duration of a dot is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code transmission. The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot. After each dot or dash in a character, there is a time when the signal is absent, called a space, equal to the duration of a dot. For example, the standard emergency distress signal SOS is expressed in Morse code as shown in the figure below. ![150px-SOS.svg.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2020/png/2392200/1603846441960-5e9f2c7f-7de0-42a9-97f4-80a551dd156c.png#averageHue=%235a0000&height=10&id=bGB4N&originHeight=10&originWidth=150&originalType=binary&ratio=1&rotation=0&showTitle=false&size=1097&status=done&style=none&title=&width=150) If it's expressed in sound, it sounds like this. As can be seen, Morse code essentially encodes duration to transmit signals. With such encoding rules, people can present duration in many ways, such as intermittently emitting sounds, intermittently lighting up searchlights, etc., to ultimately achieve the purpose of sending information. ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2020/jpeg/2392200/1603846838461-ea51e722-f05f-478d-be0f-f1327907c17a.jpeg#averageHue=%237f909f&height=962&id=WHt1r&originHeight=1011&originWidth=800&originalType=binary&ratio=1&rotation=0&showTitle=false&size=0&status=done&style=none&title=&width=761) Source of the picture:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code> Morse code was used most when communication was not developed. People used Morse code for long-distance information transmission through radio. The old device below is an early telegraph device, where the operator controls the long and short signals of the telegraph by pressing the circular handle on the right. ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2020/jpeg/2392200/1603846816937-54826ec7-a061-46e9-b51e-61e0caf679fb.jpeg#averageHue=%23c7c7bf&height=657&id=dvnyK&originHeight=876&originWidth=1024&originalType=binary&ratio=1&rotation=0&showTitle=false&size=0&status=done&style=stroke&title=&width=768) Source of the picture: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code> If you are interested in Morse code, you can visit the following website. The website can translate the letters and numbers you enter into Morse code and provide a download of the sound file. <https://morsedecoder.com/> \## 1.3.2 Task 1: Automatic Broadcasting of "SOS" \### Analysis Automatic broadcasting means that when the control board is started, the onboard buzzer automatically emits the Morse code of "SOS". The program is written in three steps:

-   Define the buzzer pin
-   Initialization, setting the state of the buzzer pin
-   Loop the buzzer to play the Morse code of "SOS"

Let's first look at how to reflect the Morse code of "SOS" through the program. If you import the audio file of Morse code into the audio editing software, you can see the waveform of the sound and the duration of each syllable, which is generally divided into long and short sounds. To facilitate understanding and programming, we use a binary way to mark the switch of the buzzer, 1 indicates the buzzer is on, 0 indicates the buzzer is off, and the gray number represents how long the current status needs to last. After a Morse code ends, because it needs to be looped, you need to leave time between the two Morse codes, here it is set to 0.8 seconds. ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2020/png/2392200/1603866605792-3b94b31b-4bff-426f-8166-d1dae05f5856.png#averageHue=%23646464&height=529&id=yQCMh&originHeight=529&originWidth=1405&originalType=binary&ratio=1&rotation=0&showTitle=false&status=done&style=none&title=&width=1405)

To emit a short sound, which corresponds to a dot in Morse code, from the buzzer, you can use the following code in Arduino:

``` cpp
tone(pinBuzzer, 200);
delay(100);
noTone(pinBuzzer);
delay(100);
```

In this code snippet:

-   `tone(pinBuzzer, 200)` generates a sound at a frequency of 200 Hz on the buzzer connected to the `pinBuzzer` pin.
-   `delay(100)` waits for 100 milliseconds. This is how long the sound lasts.
-   `noTone(pinBuzzer)` stops the sound on the buzzer.
-   The final `delay(100)` ensures there's a pause before the next sound is generated, representing the space between the signals.

The code you provided is a complete Arduino program for emitting the SOS Morse code signal using a buzzer. Here is the English explanation: \#### Writing the Program **Step 1:** Define pins and create variables

``` cpp
int pinBuzzer = 3; // Define the buzzer on pin 3, if you're using XIAO RP2040/XIAO ESP32, change 3 to A3
```

**Step 2:** Set pin state

``` cpp
void setup() {
    pinMode(pinBuzzer, OUTPUT); // Set the buzzer pin to output state
}
```

**Step 3:** Loop to play "SOS" Morse code

``` cpp
void loop() {
    // Emit three short signals:
    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
        tone(pinBuzzer, 200);
        delay(100);
        noTone(pinBuzzer);
        delay(100);
    }
    delay(200);

    // Emit three long signals:
    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
        tone(pinBuzzer, 200);
        delay(300);
        noTone(pinBuzzer);
        delay(100);
    }
    delay(200);

    // Emit three short signals again:
    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
        tone(pinBuzzer, 200);
        delay(100);
        noTone(pinBuzzer);
        delay(100);
    }
    delay(800); // Wait before repeating
}
```

To upload the program to your hardware, connect your XIAO to your computer using the data cable included in the kit. After this, click on the verify button ![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2023/png/2392200/1674004781256-2ef9b2ff-3f2a-42e1-8c1d-cc287586a2e8.png#averageHue=%235e999d&clientId=u44ac5ada-7982-4&from=paste&height=33&id=XWVGd&originHeight=66&originWidth=70&originalType=binary&ratio=1&rotation=0&showTitle=false&size=4632&status=done&style=none&taskId=ue885d468-20b4-4a75-a714-5bdd6ab0124&title=&width=35) to check your program. If it passes verification, click on the upload button ![image.png](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2023/png/2392200/1674004809585-a8842718-f1e3-4ec8-accf-4d73c892568e.png#averageHue=%235c979b&clientId=u44ac5ada-7982-4&from=paste&height=34&id=LdJ3J&originHeight=68&originWidth=68&originalType=binary&ratio=1&rotation=0&showTitle=false&size=4597&status=done&style=none&taskId=u04fce7db-6d4d-4dee-a583-4e4b115e8fb&title=&width=34) to upload the program to your hardware. When the debug area shows "Done uploading.", you can listen to the Morse code sound. Is it the rhythm you expected? ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/0/2023/jpeg/2392200/1684977221668-62259e38-ab6e-4645-b9c9-be8b2ec59bdb.jpeg) Note the position of the buttons on the XIAO extensions used for testing in the figure. \## 1.3.3 Task 2: Control the buzzer with a button Controlling the buzzer with a button to emit Morse code can be done manually. The code logic is simple: use an if statement to determine if the button is pressed. If it is, then the buzzer emits a sound. \#### Analysis The program is also written in three steps:

-   Define the buzzer and button pins.
-   Initialize by setting the state of the buzzer and button pins.
-   Determine whether the button is pressed; if pressed, emit a sound. \#### Write the program: **Step 1:** Define the buzzer and button pins

``` cpp
const int buttonPin = 1; // The button is on pin 1, if you are using XIAO RP2040/XIAO ESP32, please change 1 to D1
int pinBuzzer = 3;// The buzzer is on pin 3, if you are using XIAO RP2040/XIAO ESP32, please change 3 to A3
```

**Step 2:** Set the button and buzzer pin states

``` cpp
void setup() {
    // Set the buzzer pin as output:
    pinMode(pinBuzzer, OUTPUT);
    // Set the button pin as input:
    pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
}
```

**Step 3:** Check the button state, if the button is pressed, the buzzer sounds. Here, the `tone()` function is used to control the passive buzzer to make a sound.

``` cpp
void loop() {
    // buttonState is the button variable, read the button state and store it in the variable:
    int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

    // Check if the button is pressed, if the button is pressed:
    if (buttonState == LOW) {
        // The buzzer sounds with a frequency of 200, for a duration of 200 milliseconds
        tone(pinBuzzer, 200, 200);
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ Note: There are two identical buttons on the expansion board, one is the RESET button, which is closer to the Type-C interface, and the other is the user-defined button, which is closer to the lithium battery interface. When testing, press the one closer to the lithium battery interface.

The complete program is as follows:

``` cpp
/*
 * Button-SOS
 */
const int buttonPin = 1; // The button is on pin 1, if you are using XIAO RP2040/XIAO ESP32, please change 1 to D1!
int pinBuzzer = 3; // The buzzer is on pin 3, if you are using XIAO RP2040/XIAO ESP32, please change 3 to A3!
void setup() {
  // Set the buzzer pin as output:
  pinMode(pinBuzzer, OUTPUT);
  // Set the button pin as input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
}
 
void loop() {
  // buttonState is the button variable, read the button state and store it in the variable:
  int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
 
  // Check if the button is pressed, if the button is pressed:
  if (buttonState == LOW) {
    // The buzzer sounds with a frequency of 200, for a duration of 200 milliseconds
    tone(pinBuzzer, 200, 200);
  }
}
```
