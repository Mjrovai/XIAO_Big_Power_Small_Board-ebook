## Book outline

-   **Chapter 1: Introduction to Hardware and Programming** In this chapter, readers start with basic programming on XIAO using Arduino IDE. Through simple example programs, they will learn to control LED lights, buttons, buzzers, and other electronic components, mastering core programming concepts like digital I/O, analog I/O, tone generation, and mapping values. By manually typing out code examples line-by-line, they will develop strong coding habits and grasp programming syntax.

-   **Chapter 2: Project Practice for Beginners - Introduction to Prototype Design** In this chapter, readers will learn the basics of designing prototypes with XIAO through beginner-friendly projects. They will start from an idea and quickly create a verification prototype, focusing more on the practical application of code rather than line-by-line analysis. By leveraging Arduino libraries, community resources, and example programs, they will learn how to find and adapt code snippets to achieve desired effects efficiently. Furthermore, they will explore how to design the physical appearance of prototypes by creatively combining electronic hardware with everyday items. The key outcomes are grasping a project-based approach and developing skills to build simple interactive prototypes.

-   **Chapter 3: Intermediate Project Practice---Complex Projects** In this chapter, readers will advance their prototyping skills by creating sophisticated IoT projects with XIAO. They will implement features like Wi-Fi connectivity, MQTT telemetry, and remote control commands using the XIAO ESP32C3. Through complex builds like an intelligent remote door, smartwatch, and air piano, you will hone programming techniques for wireless communication, cloud integration, and embedded control. Optional blueprints will be provided, but readers are encouraged to explore creative enclosure designs with alternative materials. The key outcomes are mastering intermediate IoT prototyping and preparing for advanced tinyML applications.

-   **Chapter 4: Project Practice Advanced - tinyML Application** Among the XIAO series products, the Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense has Bluetooth 5.0 wireless connectivity, low power consumption, and comes with onboard 6-axis IMU and PDM microphone sensors. The XIAO ESP32S3 Sense further integrates a camera, digital microphone, and SD card support. Those features make them powerful tools for TinyML (Embedded Machine Learning) projects. TinyML solves problems in a completely different way from traditional programming methods. This chapter will introduce readers to this cutting-edge field by walking through the entire machine-learning workflow from data collection, training, and testing to deployment and inference using the Edge Impulse Studio tool.

-   **Chapter 5: Creative Experiments** Since its launch, the Seeed Studio XIAO series has been widely acclaimed for its compact size, powerful performance, and versatile product range. The maker community has produced a large number of projects created with XIAO. Due to space constraints, we have selected some outstanding projects made with XIAO by our makers. These projects fully demonstrate the powerful functions and wide applications of XIAO. Let us follow the makers' steps, stimulate creativity, and explore the endless possibilities of XIAO. Readers can draw inspiration from these projects, use imagination, and explore new territories with XIAO.
