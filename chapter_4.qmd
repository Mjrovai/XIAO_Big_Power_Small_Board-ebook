# Chapter 4: Project Practice Advanced - TinyML Applications
<br />
Among the XIAO series products, the Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense has Bluetooth 5.0 wireless connectivity, low power consumption, and onboard 6-axis IMU and PDM microphone sensors. Besides, the XIAO ESP32S3 Sense further integrates PSRAM, a camera, a digital microphone, and SD card support.

> Those characteristics make those devices powerful tools for TinyML (Tiny Machine Learning) projects.

TinyML solves problems in a completely different way from traditional programming methods. This chapter will introduce you to this cutting-edge field by walking through the entire TinyML workflow, from data collection, pre-processing, model definition, training, testing, and deployment to allow actual inference on the physical world.
